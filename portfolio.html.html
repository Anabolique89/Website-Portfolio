          <h6>Myself</h6>
          </div>
       <div></div>          <p>My name is<em> Popovici Nina Andreea</em>,  I did <strong>taste</strong> art since early childhood when I started to imagine and  draw the bedtime stories  told by my parents and grandparents. At the beginning I have started small, on scrap paper, then in one day, exhausting all the pages, I was looking at the walls in my room, then with a smile and <strong>exploratory </strong>heart I dared to expand my visions on those 4 immaculate “canvases” . I have created my own virtual world, timeless, with my heroes, unseen creatures and <strong>surreal</strong>, all imagined, deformed and transformed by my own understanding and imagination ... I have been in <strong>love</strong> with drawing ever since, as it offered me inner peace, smiles and <strong>serenity</strong>, things that the majority of us are craving. I am currently studying <em>Multimedia Design and Communication </em> at KEA University in Copnehagen, Denmark. This portfolio is a summary of my best work of the first semester. </p>

                <h1>Web Design</h1>
                <p>My process of creation begins with paper and pencil. I like to create many different layouts for my websites. I often get inspired from other websites that catch my imagination and interest. I look for inspiration in very colourfull and dense designs but in this case I tryed to keep it as simple and professional as possible.
					Everything can be found on the main page, all the content can be found on the same page and can be reached as you scroll further down. I have a dark navy blue as a dominant colour, even tho I like picture backgrounds because they are more fluid and create an atmosphere of mistery. I added a playfull mix of yellow and blue for my highlights and links. The mobile has been designed mainly for mobile use, but can be viewed on a desktop and Ipad also.

                <h1>Project Management</h1>
                <p>I have extensive project management experience, dealing with organising events, workshops, travel and art! I have organised many mural projects and have been in charge but also I love collaborating with people and taking orders, because no matter if people hold a very individual ideal these days, the truth is that true greatness can only be achieved when working in groups, and when every member makes a compromise and a sacrifice in order to achieve the full potential.

                <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
				<p>I have mostly studied graphics ever since high school and into university. I have been a freelance graphic designer ever since, and had many design jobs, which actually helped me improve dramatically. Life is a journey of learning every single day. My passion is visual art, murals, paintings, graffiti, etc.  </p>

            <p>I have shared with you my first website, it is not very professional, but it shows the progress I made along the way. Starting from scratch as a total begginer, I feel that I can add more to it for improvement, but it's always good to keep a record of your progress. This is my original creation, from the code to the content of the website, containing my personal artworks. </p>

            <p>
                Digital print operators use computers to create layouts and printed materials that are sent to printing presses for production. Their job is to listen to client specifications and adjust attributes such as size and resolution to create a high-quality finished product. People who have a strong eye for detail and who enjoy working with graphic design and technology can thrive as digital print operators. Every day, they manage multiple projects with varying timelines. Digital print operators can work full or part time and are typically employed in the commercial printing, marketing, and publishing industries.

                <h1>Graphic Design Freelancer</h1>
            <p>
               Freelancing is like a breath of fresh air. It breaks the monotony of the routine schedule and helps us to follow our passion. There is no joy beyond the thrill, excitement and satisfaction we attain while following our heart. Every person is an entrepreneur by birth, and we are genetically framed to be one. As we grow, we get hobbled by commitments and reality, and we settle. Somewhere along the line, we reject the broken dreams with a heavy heart. There has been a significant increment in the freelancer’s population in the past few years. Education and exposure have urged people to follow their passion.

               The visual arts are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video, filmmaking, design, crafts, and architecture. Many artistic disciplines (performing arts, conceptual art, textile arts) involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types.
