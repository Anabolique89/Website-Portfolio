   Original Story: “Suffering from insomnia, disturbed loner Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job as a New York City cabbie, haunting the streets nightly, growing increasingly detached from reality as he dreams of cleaning up the filthy city. When Travis meets pretty campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he becomes obsessed with the idea of saving the world, first plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate, then directing his attentions toward rescuing 12-year-old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).”

            <p>
A character sheet is a record of a player character in a role-playing game, including whatever details, notes, game statistics, and background information a player would need during a play session. Character sheets can be found in use in both traditional and action role-playing games. Almost all roleplaying games make use of character sheets in some fashion; even "rules-light" systems and freeform role-playing games record character details in some manner.
				This is our work sheet where we have illustrated the two main characters in our interactive movie poster.

        <h1>The Sprite Sheet</h1>
        <p>A sprite sheet is a bitmap image file that contains several smaller graphics in a tiled grid arrangement. By compiling several graphics into a single file, you enable Animate and other applications to use the graphics while only needing to load a single file.</p>

		<p>Group 5 - Peer review                                                                                                                    
The feedback which we received was from group number one. They mentioned a few things that we decided to change. They were speaking their minds as well as giving us clear and very useful information that we will definitely develop in our project. 
Lack of information where and when the viewer may actually see the movie was one of the comments. After short discussion we came with the idea how to present the information to the viewer. We specified the place as well as time. 
Next comment from group number one concerned our main goal which is to encourage the viewer to watch the movie. They advised us to specify it even more. By doing that we will be sure that the viewer will interpret our project correctly. That was a very useful comment. Following the advise we simplified some misunderstandings and made our goal more readable to the viewer. <br>

				<p>Last but not least was comment about our illustrations and GIF-s. Our reviewers said a few nice words about our work in that field. They also specified some things that we can change to make our artwork even more excellent. <br>
They overall conclusion was very flattering, which is heart-warming to hear. Brainstorm and review from the group was very helpful and definitely needed. We are hoping our project is now better that it was before. Feedback gave as extra fuel and boost to work even harder on our project. We are very grateful for the time and attention from the group one.
