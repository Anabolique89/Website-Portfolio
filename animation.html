   Story: “It was a warm, sunny day in September when Anabel decided to go out and paint in a new spot that people had told her about. She had never been there before, so she didn’t know what to expect… but this always adds to the excitement!
As she reaches the spot, she finds some lovely concrete walls, half of which have never been touched by paint before. “This is looking promising for an abstract piece, she thinks.”
The location is situated under a bridge with two walls on each side of a small river in England.
So she starts.
As she paints for a few good hours, the sun starts to slowly go down, leaving her in dark shadows with her almost finished painting.
“Uff … So cold and dark…” 
She starts feeling the cold breeze of the soft wind and as she turns to swipe the very last stroke, the two big eyes on the wall painting start to blink! After which, the wall creature starts talking to her in riddles. 
Anabel freaks out and as she turns and gets up from crouching, a butterfly appears and flies off, uncovering a ray of light shining bright.  Followed by a calm sigh.”

    <h1>The Storyboard</h1>
    
    <p>A <strong>storyboard </strong>is a graphic organizer in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture, <strong>animation</strong>, motion graphic or interactive media sequence. The storyboarding process, in the form it is known today, was developed at Walt Disney Productions during the early 1930s, after several years of similar processes being in use at Walt Disney and other animation studios..

            <p>
A character sheet is a record of a player character in a role-playing game, including whatever details, notes, game statistics, and background information a player would need during a play session. Character sheets can be found in use in both traditional and action role-playing games. Almost all roleplaying games make use of character sheets in some fashion; even "rules-light" systems and freeform role-playing games record character details in some manner.

        <h1>The Sprite Sheet</h1>
        <p>A sprite sheet is a bitmap image file that contains several smaller graphics in a tiled grid arrangement. By compiling several graphics into a single file, you enable Animate and other applications to use the graphics while only needing to load a single file.</p>

				<h1>Design Principles</h1>
  <p>Amongst some design principles that I've used are : contrast ( here, I have used some desaturated background, and negative space, in order to force the eye upon the very bold and colourfull elements found in my composition. There is a monochrome contrast also, on some pages, but mostly the light - dark contrast comes into play on all designed pages.), rythm (I have purpusefully repeated some of the items, banners, buttons.   </p>
            <p>The Gestalt Principles are a set of laws arising from 1920s’ psychology, describing how humans typically see objects by grouping similar elements, recognizing patterns and simplifying complex images. Designers use these to engage users via powerful -yet natural- “tricks” of perspective and best practice design standards.</p>
